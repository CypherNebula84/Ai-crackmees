**Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unsafe Deserialization (Pickle):**
    * `pickle.loads()` can execute arbitrary code if the pickled data is malicious. This is a *very* dangerous vulnerability.
2.  **Insecure File Handling:**
    * The filename is constructed directly from user input, which can lead to path traversal attacks (e.g., accessing or modifying files outside the intended directory).
    * The files are also made world writeable after creation, using `os.chmod(...,0o777)` meaning that anyone on the system can modify them.
3.  **Unsafe Command Execution (subprocess.run):**
    * `shell=True` allows the user input to be interpreted as shell commands, which can execute arbitrary system commands. This is extremely dangerous.
    * `check=False` means that any errors that occur during the command execution will be ignored, so even if the command fails, the program will continue.
4.  **Path Traversal/Information Disclosure:**
    * The `os.path.exists()` section, while appearing benign, can be used to check the existence of arbitrary files on the system, which can be used to gather information about the file system.
5.  **No input validation:**
    * The program does not check the type, length, or content of user input, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

**How to Fix (General Guidance - Do not run the insecure code):**

* **Avoid `pickle` for untrusted data.** Use safer serialization formats like JSON.
* **Sanitize user input** before using it in filenames or commands. Use allow lists and escape special characters.
* **Never use `shell=True`** with `subprocess.run`. If you need to execute commands, use a list of arguments instead.
* **Validate file paths** to prevent path traversal.
* **Use appropriate file permissions.** Avoid making files world-writable unless absolutely necessary.
* **Validate user input** for type, length, and content.
* **Handle exceptions properly.** Don't just catch and print them; take appropriate action.
* **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements** if interacting with databases.
* **Use a linter and static analysis tools** to catch potential vulnerabilities.
* **Keep software up to date** with the latest security patches.
* **Use principle of least privilege:** Only give programs and users the permissions they absolutely need.
